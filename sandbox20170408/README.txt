PHP STRING FUNCTIONS

2017-04-08

This sandbox focuses on experimenting with several
php functions, so that greater expertise can be
obtained.

The functions focused on here are php string functions.
This includes:

	* chunk_split	(explored with chunk1.php to chunk4.php)
	* count_chars	(explored with count1.php to count7.php)
	* crc32			(explored with crc1.php to crc4.php)

The filenames are such that *2.php is evolved from *1.php etc.
In general, this is true, but not always.  Oftentimes, when
experimenting with code, a 'what if' comes to mind, and the current
file is copied to the next version, and adjustments are made.
However, there are exceptions in that a next rev is chosen, but
something totally different and unrelated to the previous rev
is tried.

While some experiments might have various outcomes, how many times
have we thought we know what was going to happen, and yet when
it was implemented, something different happened.
